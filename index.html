                    <p>
                        Hi, I’m <strong>Bruno Xavier Calmon</strong>. Originally from <strong>Rio de Janeiro,
                            Brazil</strong>, I’m currently settled in <strong>Bavaria near Nürnberg</strong>. I’m deeply
                        passionate about <strong>exploring new cultures</strong> and meeting <strong>interesting
                            people</strong>, and I believe that every new encounter is a chance to learn and grow.
                        <br /><br />
                        When I’m not working, you’ll likely find me enjoying my favorite hobby: playing
                        <strong>metroidvania</strong> games like <em>Blasphemous 2</em> (which I just finished writing
                        this). I'm also a huge fan of <strong>hard science fiction</strong>, and at the moment, I’m
                        diving into <em>The Three-Body Problem</em>. But my hobbies don’t stop
                        there—<strong>traveling</strong>, <strong>trying new foods</strong>, and <strong>spending
                            quality time with my family</strong> are some of the things that truly bring me joy.
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm a proud <strong>dad to an amazing son</strong> and have a wonderful wife who’s my constant
                        support. Whether we’re traveling, playing games, watching TV shows, or simply enjoying life
                        together, every moment with them is precious.
                        <br /><br />
                        As much as I love spending time with my family and exploring the world, I’m also deeply
                        passionate about <strong>technology</strong>. Constantly learning and staying up-to-date with
                        the latest trends in <strong>coding and software development</strong> is not just part of my
                        job, it’s what drives me every day. I’m always seeking new challenges that help me grow as a
                        developer and as a person.

                <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    I contributed to both the Product and Customer teams, optimizing and migrating
                    core services. My journey with the company began when I was referred by my former manager at
                    Americanas.com to support the modernization of their systems.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Initially, I joined the Feed Management team, where I participated in strategy meetings to define
                    the technologies and approaches needed to transform their monolithic architecture into a scalable,
                    microservices-based solution. Later, I transitioned to the Customer team, where I led efforts to not
                    only migrate legacy systems to a microservices architecture but also adopt modern technologies like
                    Golang, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    These projects were deployed on the Azure cloud platform, focusing on delivering robust, scalable,
                    and efficient solutions that aligned with the company's growth and modernization goals. My work
                    involved close collaboration with cross-functional teams, ensuring successful implementation and
                    knowledge sharing across the organization.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Key contributions include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Service Maintenance and Optimization:</strong>
                        Initially part of the Product team, I was responsible for maintaining a large Java monolith that
                        managed catalog feed updates. However, the application faced several bottlenecks, leading to
                        frequent failures and inconsistencies in product information. After identifying the primary
                        bottleneck, I designed and implemented a decoupled microservice using an event-driven
                        architecture and the pipeline pattern to optimize image processing tasks.

                        This microservice not only offloaded the image processing workload from the legacy application,
                        significantly boosting performance and stability, but also paved the way for further
                        improvements and modernization by addressing the core bottleneck.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Microservices Migration:</strong> During a major
                        restructuring, I led a team of three developers in
                        migrating all services to a microservices architecture
                        on a Kubernetes infrastructure, rewriting every service
                        in Go. This transformation enhanced system performance
                        and scalability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Database Migration:</strong> Successfully migrated the database from PostgreSQL to
                        MongoDB to meet the platform's evolving needs for greater scalability and improved handling of
                        higher data volumes. This migration ensured data integrity while optimizing performance within
                        the new microservices architecture. By adopting MongoDB, we were able to enhance the system's
                        ability to scale efficiently, support more dynamic data models, and manage growing workloads
                        seamlessly.

                    online shopping experiences across the continent.

                    <br />
                    I worked on maintaining and developing resilient, scalable software and architectures that processed
                    vast amounts of real-time data with excellence. This ensured not only the ability to handle the high

                <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    As a Back-End Developer at TO-Brasil, I worked on Java Web Services for CAIXA, a government bank. My
                    main responsibilities included maintaining their existing applications and developing new ones based
                    on strict specifications and requirements. We used the JSF framework and Spring MVC for these
                    projects.
                    <br /><br />
                    I was brought in to introduce <strong>TDD practices</strong> to the team. This involved organizing
                    learning sessions, mentoring team members, and helping implement TDD in both new and existing
                    applications. I also worked directly with the customer to understand their needs, keep them updated
                    on progress, and make sure our solutions aligned with their expectations. My job was to help the
                    team improve their development process while making sure we met the client’s demands.

                    Key contributions include:

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Application Development:</strong> Developed Java Web Services using the JSF Framework
                        and Spring MVC,
                        focusing on delivering high-performance applications that met client
                        specifications.</li>
                    <li><strong>TDD Training:</strong> Led training sessions to introduce TDD practices to the team,
                        filling a key knowledge gap and ensuring that the team could apply TDD effectively in their
                        work, especially for CAIXA Banco do Brasil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Automation:</strong> Implemented test automation using a Java-based Selenium
                        solution, which improved the efficiency and reliability of our testing processes, ensuring more
                        consistent and accurate results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Client Communication:</strong> Worked closely with CAIXA to understand their needs,
                        discuss enhancements, and update them on project progress. This helped maintain a strong,
                        collaborative relationship and ensured the development was aligned with their expectations.</li>

                <h4>FullStack Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    As a <strong>FullStack Developer</strong>, I was responsible for maintaining and developing robust
                    web software solutions, collaborating closely with both our development team and the company's
                    customers to deliver applications that best meet their needs. My role involved working
                    across the entire stack to ensure high-quality solutions that addressed both business requirements
                    and technical challenges.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Key contributions include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> Developed applications primarily using MVC.NET
                        framework & Drupal for dynamic content management and delivering the best user experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Designed and managed SQL databases to ensure data
                        integrity and efficient retrieval processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration & Leadership:</strong> Worked closely with my team to understand customer
                        needs and make sure we delivered the right solutions. I was involved in meetings with customers
                        to ensure we were on the same page, and I helped design and architect the software while keeping
                        the team aligned and motivated to get the job done. My focus was always on clear communication,
                        ensuring everyone was involved and we stayed focused on delivering quality work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Successfully managed a large portfolio of applications for a
                        variety of clients, from small e-commerce platforms to large internal systems for big companies,
                        all with a small team of 3-6 developers. This involved keeping systems running smoothly while
                        developing new solutions across different technologies and business cases. One of the big wins
                        was identifying and fixing a critical bug in a legacy payment module by decompiling a DLL to C
                        and rewriting the logic in Java, improving data accuracy for customer transactions. I also
                        handled meetings, mentored the team, and led software design and development to make sure our
                        solutions were reliable and scalable.</li>
